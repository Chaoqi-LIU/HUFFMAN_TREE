## Description: 
In 1951, while enrolled in an Information Theory class at MIT, David A. Huffman and his classmates were given a choice by professor Robert M. Fano: they could either take the final exam or find the most efficient binary code. Huffman chose the less traveled path, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Huffman encoding is a fundamental data compression algorithm. Data compression is a very powerful tool that can represent a given set of information in less space, allowing for more efficient data transfer. Image formats such as JPG (lossy) and PNG use various types of compression (lossless). It is also used in ZIP files to compress multiple files. The concept of data encoding can be seen in future courses such as CS 438, Communication Networks, which deals with transferring large amounts of data, and CS 461, Computer Security, which deals with data encoding for a layer of privacy.
