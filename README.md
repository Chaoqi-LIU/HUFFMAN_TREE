## Intro to Huffman Coding

* __Background Information__ \
In 1951, while enrolled in an Information Theory class at MIT, David A. Huffman and his classmates were given a choice by professor Robert M. Fano: they could either take the final exam or find the most efficient binary code. Huffman chose the less traveled path, and the rest, as they say, is history. The [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) algorithm is a fundamental¬†data compression algorithm. Data compression is a powerful tool that allows a given set of information to be represented in less space, allowing for more efficient data transfer. JPG (lossy) and PNG image formats use various types of compression (lossless). It is also used to compress multiple files in ZIP files. Communication Networks, which deal with transferring large amounts of data, and Computer Security, which deals with data encoding for a layer of privacy, both use the concept of data encoding.
